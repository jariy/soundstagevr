The TrackTemplates folder contains Track Templates for use of the MPEG-H Authoring Plug-in in REAPER.

Just copy the folder to the following location:

Mac: /<Your Username>/Library/Application Support/REAPER/
Windows: C:\Users\<Your Username>\AppData\Roaming\REAPER\TrackTemplates

You can now recall these TrackTemplates by choosing Track -> Insert Track from Template or right-clicking the track section and choosing a template from there.
Then just insert the Plug-in on the parent bus and drop in your audio files.

HINT: Don't forget to adjust the Track Channel count and output routing of your Master Track!

The setup in these templates is just one way to do the routing, there are other options that work just as good. Just choose whatever best suits your workflow.
